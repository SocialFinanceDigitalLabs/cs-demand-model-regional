    <h1>Adjust transition rates</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        You may want to change the rate of children per day moving between different placement types to give a more accurate
        picture of future forecasting or simply to explore what changes you may expect to see. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Rates are applied to the daily population of children. For example, a rate of 0.5 from Fostering to Residential means
        that each day, 50% of children in Fostering will move to Residential.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adjustments are always applied to the initial base rate produced by the model parameters you selected. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If changes you make to rates results in a placement type having rates that sum to more than 1, the model will adjust the rates to sum to 1. 
        For example, if you set the rate for children in leaving 5-10 Fostering to 0.5 and the rate for children moving from 5-10 Fostering to 
        Residential to 0.6, the model will scale these down (to 0.45 and 0.55 respectively) and set any other rates for that placement 
        (e.g. 5-10 Fostering to Other) to 0. You can view the results of your rate adjustments on <a href="{% url 'adjusted' %}">Adjust Forecast</a>.
